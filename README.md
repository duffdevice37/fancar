FanCar - javascript carousel UI homework

This is a javascript demo that takes a list on the page and turns it into a carousel-style control.

Layout is handled in javascript to give maximum flexibility for things like momentum simulation and snapping to elements in a smooth way.

Potential future improvements:
  - make it a little more configurable and able to instantiate anywhere on the page.
  - infinite scrolling including server integration.
  - currently no way to read back the selected item or get notified when it changes.
